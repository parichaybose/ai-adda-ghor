# Architecting an AI-Based Application: End-to-End Understanding

This document is a structured capture of a deep-dive discussion exploring how to build an AI-based application ‚Äî from first principles to agentic orchestration. It tracks the journey from traditional software development to building conversational, reasoning, and orchestrating AI systems using modern tools like LangChain, LangGraph, and open-source LLMs.

## üß≠ Starting Point: What Makes an Application 'AI-Based'?

> "I‚Äôm a software architect. Just like I can build systems without knowing how to create an OS, database, or compiler, I believe I can build AI applications without building an LLM myself."

Correct. You don‚Äôt need to build your own LLM. Instead, you:
- Use existing **LLMs** (e.g., GPT, Claude, LLaMA)
- Compose them with **orchestration tools** (LangChain, LangGraph)
- Build APIs, UI, storage, and business logic just like traditional apps

| Layer             | Description                                                                        | Technology Example                     |

## üì¶ From Input to Execution ‚Äî High-Level Flow

1. **UI** captures user query: "Activate LTE on my SIM"
2. **Backend** receives it via HTTP and passes it to the orchestrator (LangChain)
3. **LangChain**:
   - Uses memory to recall previous context
   - Retrieves related info from vector DB (e.g., what LTE activation needs)
   - Constructs a final prompt
4. **LLM** decides the next step: e.g., "Ask for MSISDN" or "Call SIM activation API"
5. **LangChain/LangGraph**:
   - Executes API call
   - Moves to the next step in a flow
   - Returns user-facing response

## üß† The Seven Key Steps in AI-Driven Knowledge Retrieval

These are foundational to building any RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system:

| Step              | Input                                  | Output                            | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Document Ingestion** | PDFs, websites, databases               | Raw text                          | Fetches external content into the pipeline                                  |
| **2. Chunking**           | Raw text                               | Structured text chunks            | Breaks long text into smaller units for accurate embedding                  |
| **3. Embedding**          | Text chunks                            | Vectors                           | Converts text to vector form using embedding model (OpenAI, HuggingFace)   |
| **4. Vector DB Store**    | Vectors + metadata                     | Indexed vector collection         | Stores vectors in a searchable DB (Qdrant, FAISS, etc.)                     |
| **5. Retrieval**          | User query (vector form)               | Top-K similar chunks              | Semantic search to find relevant documents                                  |
| **6. Prompt Template**    | Retrieved content + question           | Prompt string                     | Formats the query for the LLM with helpful context                          |
| **7. LLM Integration**    | Prompt                                 | LLM-generated response            | The LLM generates final natural language output                             |

These steps are **sequentially dependent** and form a pipeline that transforms unstructured content into actionable conversational intelligence.

## üîç What is Agentic Behavior?

> Agentic = LLM that can observe, plan, decide, act, and adapt.

Instead of one-shot Q&A, the system behaves like a smart assistant.

Example:
- Detects provisioning is needed
- Asks for MSISDN if missing
- Calls APIs in correct sequence
- Retries or rolls back if needed
- Returns a natural confirmation message

Implemented via:
- **LangGraph**: defines the workflow logic, states, transitions
- **LangChain**: manages prompt creation, memory, tools, API calls
- **LLM (e.g., GPT, LLaMA)**: decides, reasons, and generates messages

## üß∞ LangChain vs LangGraph

| Feature            | LangChain                                     | LangGraph                                   |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Purpose            | Orchestrates LLM calls, memory, tools         | Manages structured flow via graph logic     |
| Type of Flow       | Mostly linear                                 | Branching, retries, conditionals, loops     |
| Use Case           | Chatbot, tool use, simple agents              | Complex, multi-step flows (e.g., provisioning) |
| Observability      | Manual                                        | Built-in state & transition visibility      |

## üîß Where Does Memory Fit?

Memory helps:
- Track conversation turns
- Store user responses and intermediate decisions
- Avoid repeating questions

Used by LangChain and LangGraph to pass state across LLM calls.

---

## üìå Dynamic Orchestration Use Case

> "Can I activate LTE service on this SIM?"

System:
1. Detects intent (provisioning)
2. Checks required info
3. Asks for SIM/MSISDN
4. Calls APIs: SIM ‚Üí HSS ‚Üí LTE HSS ‚Üí PCRF
5. Confirms success/failure in natural language

This becomes a **dynamic workflow engine**, like a conversational BPM system.

## ‚úÖ Open-Source End-to-End Stack (No OpenAI Needed)

| Layer         | Open-Source Tool                             |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| LLM           | Meta LLaMA 3, Mistral, DeepSeek               |
| Embeddings    | GTE, BGE, Instructor, HuggingFace models      |
| Vector DB     | Qdrant, FAISS, Weaviate, Chroma               |
| LangChain     | Yes                                           |
| LangGraph     | Yes                                           |
| Hosting LLM   | Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, Text Generation UI   |

You can run the full pipeline **in-house** with **no API cost**, **full data control**, and **custom behavior**.
